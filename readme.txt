WipeDisk v1.00 - Save way to delete all files on a floppy.

This is a FAPI app for cleaning out files on a floppy. It will only work on
removeable drives, so it is fairly safe. It will leave the extended attributes
file alone. I have included the source code, but would prefer that you not
update the program and redistibute it.
